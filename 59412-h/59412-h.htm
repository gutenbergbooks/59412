<p>It will not take long to realize or remember that of all
America&rsquo;s riches, the inherited and acquired, the natural
and manmade, trees are among our most cherished.</p>
<p>It would be a poorer nation indeed without them, if a
nation at all. As living creatures they delight the eye and
inspire belief as you walk among them. As wood, logged
and hewn, they serve civilization in myriad ways.</p>
<p>When the Founding Fathers arrived, the native American
forest stretched almost unbroken from the Atlantic
to the Great Plains and beyond the Plains to the Pacific.
Trees were the source of their first crude forts, of their
furniture, firewood, fruit, and even of their medicines.
Game and fish for the table of pioneers were harvested in
cool woodland shadows.</p>
<p>The Nation&rsquo;s forests have shrunk appreciably through
the years, yet today almost 800 different species of native
trees and hundreds of others introduced from foreign
lands grow and thrive in the United States. They fulfill
many purposes. Peach, apple, and cherry are trees of the
orchard. Sheltering your home, shading your street, or
lending dignity to your city park may be the elm, oak,
maple, weeping willow, or handsome, slow-growing English
yew. You may be on speaking terms with a nearby
Lombardy poplar, a slender, stately tree which President
Thomas Jefferson once planted in rows along Pennsylvania
Avenue in Washington. Or perhaps the wide-spreading
ornamental hackberry, which like all trees
serves more than a single use: robins and mockingbirds
thrive on its purple-black berries.</p>
<p>Other types of trees, including more than 175 species of
commercial value, grace our contemporary forest. They
add to the grandeur and glory of our land, immeasurable
in their fullest meaning, though in a tangible sense furnishing
food and protective cover to wildlife, shade and
firewood to campers, and timber to us all.</p>
<p>The future of the forest? One day walk in the managed
stands of our 154 National Forests. Observe how these
lands are managed for many uses, how their trees benefit
from man&rsquo;s touch and influence, and how logging with a
purpose enhances the health of the forest and its value
to your children&rsquo;s children. Meanwhile, follow through
these pages the story of growing trees and timber on the
National Forests.</p>

<h3 id="c2"><i>Light, Water, Soil, and Space for Growth</i></h3>
<p>What are the National Forests from which much of our
timber comes?</p>
<p>Trees are their dominant characteristic, but trees are
hardly alone or even self-sufficient, for a forest is a vibrantly
complex, interwoven community of many forms
of life. Within its depths the tree, shrubby plant, large
animal, and minute creature struggle together and
against each other to survive and to perpetuate their
species.</p>
<p>From the beginning to the end of its days, the tree exerts
a ceaseless effort in the contest for life. Like man,
it must have air, light, heat, water, and food. Having
once taken root, it can never move to another spot&mdash;yet
within its own sphere it acts and reacts in drawing nourishment
from soil and air. Roots penetrate downward
for water and mineral foods. The trunk carries these to
the crown and outward to the leaves. Meanwhile, within
tiny leaf cells the amazing green pigmentation called
chlorophyll captures light waves and the energy of the
sun. These combine with carbon dioxide breathed from
the air to form a simple sugar, later converted into other
carbohydrates and then into wood. The tree shows its
growth and age through the addition each year of a coat
of new wood cells formed by the cambium layer between
the outside layer of the sapwood and the bark. The sapwood
is the living tissue through which water passes from
roots to crown.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02a.jpg" alt="Open woods" width="264" height="800" />
</div>
<p>In field and lawn, the shade tree has space to reach
<i>upward and outward</i> for its sunlight. As it grows, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
limbs spread and the crown becomes broad and rounded.
But the forest tree lives close to its neighbors, and in
turning to the sun must reach <i>upward</i>. Its lower
branches, cut off from sunlight, wither and fall. It develops
height, with a long, clean trunk, attractive to the
eye and highly suited for the milling of its wood into
thousands of useful products.</p>
<p>Beneath the canopy of upper limbs and leaves, openings
on the forest floor fill with little trees. They shoot up
from the ground or sprout from the stumps of old trees
which have died or been cut. They test their strength to
survive against lesser plants, insects, and animals, for
whom <i>they</i> are the sustenance of life. And they must
compete with each other.</p>
<p>But survival of the fitter does not produce National
Forests of the fullest value in our modern day, for not all
tree species are useful to man. These and other undesirable
forest vegetation fight for their share of soil and
water and, if strong enough, crowd out or slow the growth
of more desirable trees. Very old trees, like very old
people, become afflicted with infirmities. They suffer disease
and decadence; unlike people, they seldom die alone,
for they threaten an entire forest by inviting infestation
by insects and creating conditions favorable to fire.</p>
<p>Through forest management and its implements, including
timber cutting, National Forests are cared for in
their own best interests and in the interests of man. The
most useful trees are perpetuated in their proper environment
through <i>silviculture</i> (<i>silva</i>, the forest, and <i>culture</i>,
to cultivate), the science of producing and caring for a
forest.</p>
<p>How does this work? The Forest Service ranger, to
begin with, must understand the surroundings in which
specific trees are born from their seeds and the conditions
which produce their best growth. He must also be familiar
with society&rsquo;s use and needs for timber-type trees.
These constitute two general classes: Softwoods or conifers,
the mostly evergreen cone bearers; and the hardwoods
or broadleaf trees, of which most are deciduous,
that is, shed their foliage in the fall.</p>
<p>Among the conifers are pine, fir, spruce, redwood, and
hemlock. Conifers, the oldest of tree families, were widespread
on the face of the earth millions of years ago. The
somber giant sequoias still stand as living history pre-dating
the birth of Jesus. Bristlecone pines have been
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
found that range from 4,000 to 4,600 years old. Conifers
are the main strength of America&rsquo;s timber resources, providing
four-fifths of the large sawtimber trees. The
conifer is called softwood and is used extensively in construction
and fiber for paper pulp.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="Pine cone and needles" width="400" height="654" />
</div>
<p>Broadleaf trees include oaks, maples, elms, and sycamore.
Their wood is used in furniture, among other
purposes, and together they are called hardwoods (although
a few are softer than some softwoods).</p>
<p>The forest manager knows that deciduous trees require
some moisture throughout the year, while conifers can
survive where it is concentrated mostly in winter snowfall.
But this is only the start, for there is also the magic
of tree seeds to fathom, interpret, and adapt.</p>
<p>Seeds range in weight from the heavy, large black
walnut down to specks almost as fine as sand. Some are
borne on wings, so remarkably balanced that they ride
the winds for miles. Some are sown <i>only</i> by birds and
other animals&mdash;if not consumed by them first! Many
trees produce seeds every year, others less often or irregularly.
Of every 100 seeds reaching the ground, only a
few may sprout. And the cones of some trees, like jack
pine in the Lake States (sometimes called fire pine), and
knobcone pine in the West, are opened and their seeds
prepared for germination by fire.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03a.jpg" alt="Root system" width="800" height="343" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>The forest manager must reckon with seed behavior
and the complex conditions required for seeds to take
root and reproduce the forest. Some are best allowed to
seed naturally from mature parent trees. Others are best
sown by hand or by airplane. Millions of seedlings are
grown in National Forest nurseries and are planted in
the forest by hand and by machines. Then, once in the
ground, the young trees (plantations) may require some
shade to survive, freedom from competing brush, and
protection from animals, insects, and fire. Providing
this is called plantation care.</p>
<p>Forest trees are also classified by their tolerance and
intolerance to shade. Sugar maple, for instance, is called
a tolerant tree because it will endure as a youngster with
only a minimum of sunlight under the cover of taller
trees. But Douglas-fir is relatively intolerant to shade,
as is black cherry.</p>
<p>Various silvicultural cutting practices are used to obtain
the desired degree of light and to encourage seedling
establishment. Cutting can alter the density of the forest
canopy or <i>overstory</i> to enable more light to reach the
forest floor. Or it can open a new bed for seed if located
the proper distance from nearby uncut stands. For southern
pines, such a distance is usually not over 500 feet;
for red spruce, in contrast, it may be as far as 1,500 feet.</p>
<p>In essence, three systems of harvest cutting are applied
on the National Forests: Selection cutting, seed tree cutting,
and clear cutting, with variations based on specific
terrain and other conditions.</p>
<p>Some forests are best managed through selection or
partial cutting. In starting harvest of a virgin stand,
older trees are cut first. So are the defective and diseased.
Younger, healthier trees are encouraged, by this release
from competition, to further growth&mdash;much like the weeding
of a garden. The forest is also opened to stimulate
new seedling growth. In seed tree cutting, the entire
stand is logged except for a few carefully selected seed
trees which are left to regenerate the forest. These, in
turn, are harvested after the new stand has been successfully
started.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03c.jpg" alt="Forest suited for selective cutting" width="400" height="549" />
</div>
<p>Douglas-fir, however, is one of several species best managed
with clear cutting in blocks. Selection cutting of the
lusty giant has been tried in the National Forests, but with
little success. It proved difficult to remove the tall Douglas-firs,
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
standing over 200 feet, without seriously injuring
others as they fell. Those remaining in a stand, shorn of
protection from neighboring trees above and interweaving
roots below, became victims of blowdown in high
winds. Nor would Douglas-fir reproduce itself without
benefit of full sunlight. Thus, clear cutting or patch cutting
is practiced on blocks of 40 to 100 acres; this enables
sunlight to reach the ground and to help the valuable
Douglas-fir forest renew itself. Seeding by hand or by
airplane and planting nursery-grown seedlings are methods
used to reforest these large openings.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>The Balances of Management</i></span></h2>
<p>Throughout the 182 million acres of the National Forests
other important factors are weighed in the balance
with the need to produce timber. They may be the reason
for heavy cutting, light cutting, or no cutting.</p>
<p>Wildlife, for example, has become increasingly dependent
upon the National Forests. Almost everywhere the
land available to it has been reduced through the spread of
towns, cities, industries, and highways. It is estimated
that the native American forest once covered more than
900 million acres, with extensive borders and many open
places where grass, plants, and herbs grew and served as
food for deer, elk, wild turkey, and other animals and
birds. In our modern managed forests, clear cutting and
heavy selection cutting make more food available to animals
and birds by opening clearings and creating <i>edges</i>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, fish are benefited by not harvesting
timber along the streamside. The forest canopy provides
shade and a favorably cool temperature. Insects fall in
the water from overhanging branches, providing food.
Roots of trees and shrubs bind the soil, holding banks in
place, affording sheltered retreats along the streamside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="Conifer forest" width="800" height="622" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05a.jpg" alt="Pine seedling" width="237" height="300" />
</div>
<p>A vital factor in balanced management is the need to
protect the forest as a natural reservoir of water. Uncontrolled
logging and fire can strip the land of its porous
cover, leaving it unable to absorb water. The disastrous
consequences are soil erosion, flash floods, and muddy
streams. Thus, as soil conditions require, the forester
may plan light to moderate selection cuttings. Or in other
cases, as in the Southwest where virgin timber grows
amid a dense understory of young growth and water is in
short supply for a growing population, he may consider
heavy thinnings to replace deep-rooted trees with grasses
and broadleaf herbs, making more water available for
human use.</p>
<p>In campgrounds and picnic areas, recreation values are
protected by limiting cutting to dead, dying, and diseased
trees. In natural areas, old trees and surrounding vegetation
are subject only to minimum management so that
visitors may read living history as written on the land.
In wilderness and wild areas, timber cutting is not allowed.
Those primitive lands, 14&frac12; million acres in all,
have been dedicated by the Forest Service to wilderness
use and are protected in their natural state for those who
enjoy extensive foot or horseback travel in serenity and
solitude.</p>
<p>Each forest resource and each of the many uses of resources
is needed in the pattern of a growing Nation.
Each is accorded its place in balancing National Forest
plans of management.</p>

<p class="pcap">Trees, like people, have their own
characteristics and habits. The stand,
or community of forest trees, nearest
your home is as different from the next
one as your town or city differs from
the town in the next county. This
means that the National Forests,
ranging through 39 States and a Commonwealth&mdash;from
the White and
Green Mountains of New England
south to Puerto Rico, westward to the
Pacific and north to Alaska&mdash;must be
managed, harvested, and renewed in
different ways.</p>

on the landscape wherever they stand. As forest trees, they
are grown to serve many useful purposes. You can derive more
enjoyment from your travels through the National Forests by

</blockquote>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="Douglas-Fir" width="366" height="801" />
</div>
<p><b><i>Douglas-Fir</i></b>, the State tree of Oregon, produces more
wood products than any other American tree and perhaps
is the world&rsquo;s most valuable species of conifer. It grows
in moist forests from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific
coast, reaching its largest size on the western slopes of
the Cascade Mountains and along the northwest coast,
where soil is rich and moisture plentiful. Douglas-fir
grows second in size only to the California sequoias, giant
sequoia and redwood (<i>Sequoia gigantea</i> and <i>Sequoia
sempervirens</i>), with heights of 200 feet or more and diameters
of 3 to 6 feet. Under favorable conditions individual
trees may live a thousand years, grow 10 feet
through and 300 feet tall, with furrowed, cinnamon-brown
bark 1 foot thick.</p>
<p>Douglas-fir scatters its seed prolifically (with an average
of 42,000 seeds per pound taken over its entire range;
California has 30,000-35,000, British Columbia 49,000)
and young trees grow fast and dense in the mineral soil of
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
the Northwest. At 10 years they are 15 feet high, and in
25 years are twice as tall with sometimes as many as 1,000
trees to the acre. As they grow, the forest thins naturally;
in a century the trees can reach 200 feet in height and may
then number about 115 to the acre.</p>
<p>Small trees are hardy and attractive for ornamental
planting. With their soft, rich green needles hanging on
long after cutting, they are also beautiful and popular
Christmas trees.</p>
<p>The wood, yellowish to light red in color, is strong for
its fairly light weight, and is resistant to decay. The size
of the tree permits the manufacture of lumber remarkably
free of knots and other defects, with pieces 60 feet
long by 2 feet square. The softwood veneer and plywood
industries depend almost entirely on Douglas-fir for raw
materials. Recently new uses (fiberboard, book paper,
wrapping paper) have been developed for sawmill
leftovers.</p>
<p>For years this unique conifer was a botanical puzzler,
having been called spruce, hemlock, balsam fir, and
even pine. The scientific name meaning false hemlock
(<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>) honors Dr. Archibald Menzies,
physician and naturalist with Captain Vancouver&rsquo;s voyage,
who discovered this tree on the Pacific coast in 1791.
It remained for the roving Scotch botanical collector
David Douglas to send the first seeds to Europe in 1827.
Soft, deep yellow-green or blue-green needles about an
inch long, flattened and pointed, grow all around the twig.
The oval cone with distinctive three-pronged bracts hangs
like a pendant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="Ponderosa Pine" width="641" height="800" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p><b><i>Ponderosa Pine</i></b>, a beautiful and hardy tree, grows in
every State west of the Great Plains, and is the State tree
of Montana. It has a total stand greater than any native
tree species except Douglas-fir, and reaches maximum
growth in the resin-scented Sierra forests of California:
over 200 feet in height, 5 to 8 feet in diameter, 500 years
in age.</p>
<p>During its early life ponderosa pine bark is dark brown,
nearly black, which prompts the local names &ldquo;blackjack&rdquo;
and &ldquo;bull pine.&rdquo; Then it becomes plated and scaly,
turning distinctive cinnamon-brown to orange-yellow.
Bluish-green needles, 4 to 7 inches long, grow in clusters
of three or sometimes two. The brown cones are clustered
too, standing erect on small stalks and growing 3
to 6 inches long. Like most other pines, the ponderosa&rsquo;s
cones require two seasons to mature.</p>
<p>Ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>) is the most valuable
and extensive timber tree of the Southwest, ranging in a
300-mile belt from the Gila National Forest of New
Mexico to the Kaibab Plateau of the Kaibab National
Forest in Arizona. It grows just above the sagebrush
and pinyon-juniper woodland, requiring less water than
most other commercial trees. Tenaciously the seedling
withstands drought, often surviving on only the dew of
night. A year-old tree will sink its roots 2 feet deep in
quest of water, a 4-year-old tree more than twice as deep.
In many places on these southwestern forest lands, as
many as 6,000 to 10,000 young ponderosa pines stand congested
on a single acre, competing for water, soil nutrients,
and light.</p>
<p>At its best the ponderosa pine, rising to a broad, conical
crown, makes a handsome ornamental tree. It also makes
hard, strong, and fine-grained wood. High-grade ponderosa
is used for doors, sashes, frames, and paneling;
the low-grade wood for boxes, rafters, joists, and railroad
ties.</p>

</div>
<p><b><i>Southern Pines</i></b> are now recognized as a vast, important
source for the Nation&rsquo;s future timber supply. An indication
of the South&rsquo;s role in forestry is the fact that it produces
fully 80 percent of all forest tree seedlings grown
in the United States. The pine is the State tree for both
Alabama and Arkansas.</p>
<p>The most plentiful southern pine, loblolly (<i>Pinus
taeda</i>), often grows in moist depressions which in the
early days were known as &ldquo;loblollies.&rdquo; Its needles are
borne three in a cluster and grow 6 to 9 inches long. This
rapidly growing tree develops a clean, straight trunk,
reaches maturity in about 70 years, and sometimes yields
20,000 to 30,000 board feet of timber per acre. Slash
pine (<i>Pinus elliottii</i>) is a beautiful tree of the Coastal
Plain with lustrous dark green needles, usually three in
a cluster and 8 to 12 inches long, and a purplish-brown
bark. The two other major southern pines are shortleaf
(<i>Pinus echinata</i>), with slender bluish-green needles 5
inches long or less, two or three in a cluster, and longleaf
(<i>Pinus palustris</i>), with tapering trunks up to 120 feet in
height, and dark green needles three in a cluster, 10 to
15 inches and sometimes 18 inches long. Longleaf and
slash pines are the principal sources of turpentine and
rosin, known as naval stores because of their early use in
caulking wooden ships. Six other species of pines are
native in the South. The southern pines have a variety
of other uses, notably for paper pulp, housebuilding
materials, fuel, and general millwork.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="Yellow-Poplar" width="499" height="800" />
</div>
<p><b><i>Yellow-Poplar</i></b>, or tuliptree, distinguished by its excellent
form and rapid growth, is one of the tallest and
most valuable hardwoods in the United States. Widely
distributed through the Eastern States, it grows in
sheltered coves of the Appalachians in stands mixed with
other large broadleaf trees and an understory of dogwood,
azalea, rhododendron, and many wild flowers. It is the
State tree of Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The yellow-poplar
reaches heights of 80 to 120 feet (maximum
recorded 198 feet) and diameters of 2 to 6 feet, with its
straight, deeply furrowed trunk clear of limbs for much
of its length. It may live 250 years or more.</p>
<p>Hardly any American tree has a richer tradition than
the yellow-poplar. &ldquo;Everyone,&rdquo; wrote William Byrd, in
his early <i>Natural History of Virginia</i>, &ldquo;has some of these
trees in his gardens and around the house, for ornament
and pleasure.&rdquo; Indians and settlers made dugouts of it.
The Delaware Swedes called it the &ldquo;canoe tree.&rdquo; George
Washington, who had an astonishing knowledge of many
trees and their uses, planted yellow-poplars at Mount
Vernon. Two of them, nearly 120 feet tall, still vigorous
and growing, are now the tallest trees at this great estate.</p>
<p>Though called yellow-poplar, because of its light-colored
softwood, it is really a member of the magnolia family
and bears the scientific name <i>Liriodendron tulipifera</i>,
&ldquo;lily tree bearing tulips.&rdquo; Its large flowers, a blend of
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
green and yellow tinged with orange, are among the early
spring arrivals in the forest, a welcome source of nectar
to honeybees. The blossoms emerge above a background
of long-stemmed, glossy, notched leaves that tremble in
the slightest breeze. The flowers develop into dry, cone-like
fruit, from which winged seeds fall twirling to the
ground.</p>
<p>Young trees shoot toward the light and, in some of the
best stands, grow 50 feet in 10 years. The twigs and
branches of very small yellow-poplars are tasty to deer,
which sometimes cause extensive damage.</p>
<p>With its attractive flowers, foliage, and symmetrical
form, the yellow-poplar is frequently adapted for shade
and ornamentation. The straight-grained wood of yellow-poplar
is used in furniture and woodware, for veneer, and
in construction. Its importance as a lumber tree has increased
immensely since the tragic loss of the once great
forests of chestnut. (Many foresters regarded the chestnut
as the finest hardwood tree in America before it fell
victim to a relentless blight, a fungus introduced from
Asia.) Its nuts were a food staple of squirrels, turkeys,
bears, and other animals, all of which have suffered since
the passing of the chestnut. No remedy has been found
for the blight, but Forest Service researchers have been
encouraged recently in their efforts to breed a blight-resistant
chestnut.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="Sugar Maple" width="304" height="799" />
</div>
<p><b><i>Sugar Maple</i></b>, the most abundant and versatile of all the
maples, the showy beauty of the autumn landscape, is
notable as the source of fine hardwood lumber and maple
sirup. It is found in nearly every State east of the Great
Plains, with its largest stands, usually mixed with other
hardwoods, in the Lake States and New England. Sugar
maple grows slowly but lives 300 to 400 years, reaching
heights of 80 to 120 feet. It is the State tree of New York,
Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The apt scientific name, <i>Acer saccharum</i>, refers to the
sweetness of the sap, from which maple sirup and sugar
are boiled when winter is on the wane. Like the sugarcane
and sugarbeet, this maple is characterized by an
unusually high concentration of sugar, produced the year
before and stored in roots and trunk during the dormancy
of winter. With leaf buds swelling and the imminence of
spring, the sap rises and is tapped just inside the bark by
driving in a spout and attaching a tube or hanging a
bucket beneath it. In this sturdy, stately tree, tapping
may go on for years without seriously affecting the life
of the tree or the quality of its wood. In spring, after the
sugaring-off season, the maple sends forth myriads of
greenish-yellow clustered flowers from which bees obtain
pollen and nectar. In early summer seeds mature and
fall to the ground on papery wings. Later, in autumn,
sugar residue in heart-shaped thin leaves combines chemically
with other substances to produce the most striking
orange-yellows and reds of the hardwood landscape.</p>
<p>Maple has been a choice wood since the time of the
Romans, who used it for their pikes and lances as well as
furniture. Known to the lumber trade as hard maple, the
strong, close-grained wood makes firm flooring, lustrous
furniture, bowling alleys and pins, and musical instruments.
Accidental forms known as curly maple and
birdseye maple are prized for fancy-figured furniture and
cabinets.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11a.jpg" alt="White Oak" width="396" height="799" />
</div>
<p><b><i>White Oak</i></b> has been known and loved since the earliest
days of settlement in the New World. It reminded the
colonists of the English oak&mdash;and the Indians showed how
to boil and eat its large acorns. White oak grows from
New England south to Florida, through the Middle West
to the Lake States, and as far west as Oklahoma and
Texas. It is the State tree of Connecticut and Maryland,
while &ldquo;native oak&rdquo; is the State tree of Illinois.</p>
<p>This tall, broad-crowned tree reaches heights of 80 to
100 feet (maximum, 150 feet), with diameters of 3 to 6
feet. Its whitish or pale gray bark is decidedly lighter in
color than that of the black (or red) oak group. Its scientific
name <i>Quercus alba</i> includes the classic Latin generic
name for all oaks, <i>Quercus</i>, and <i>alba</i> (white), applied by
the famous botanist Linnaeus.</p>
<p>The large leaves are formed with five to nine rounded
lobes and, unlike the black oaks, have no bristles. The
deep somber brown, or russet, of the oak leaf is a familiar
feature of the autumn landscape, and on young trees
many dead leaves remain attached throughout the winter.
Acorns, the seed of the oak, mature in early autumn.
These shiny brown, sweet-flavored nuts, known as mast,
have become an important food for bears, squirrels, and
birds, particularly with the passing of the chestnut.</p>
<p>The oak grows slowly but lives long, sometimes 500 to
600 years. In open fields or lawns the trunk is shorter
and the branches spread outward 80 feet or more. In
the forest, white oak grows best in deep humus soil
and is found in a mixture with other oaks, hickory, and
maple.</p>
<p>Of the more than 20 species of commercially important
Eastern oak, white oak is truly outstanding. From the
earliest days it provided a valuable source of timber for
houses, ships, and furniture. Strength, durability, and
beauty are the words for white oak. Its uses range from
barrels and bridges to flooring and fine cabinets.</p>

<p>The Eddy
Arboretum, named for its founder James G. Eddy, contains
species of pines from all over the world: 70 species,
35 additional varieties, and 90 different hybrids. It was
established in 1925 for breeding and improving this group
of timber trees. The Institute, working to propagate
faster growing, disease-resistant trees, is successfully
crossbreeding species such as Jeffrey and Coulter pines
into superior strains.</p>

<h3 id="c9"><span class="ss">4</span> <i>Town Creek Plantations, Centerville, Idaho, north of Idaho City Ranger Station, Boise National Forest, Intermountain Region.</i></h3>
<p>This 200 acres of new forest was
dedicated to the youth of Idaho in 1955, on the 50th anniversary
of the Forest Service. Ponderosa pine plantings
were made with different techniques every year for
5 years and are being studied in order to develop best
methods for regeneration.</p>
<h3 id="c10"><span class="ss">5</span> <i>Kaibab Plateau, managed timber areas near Jacob Lake, Ariz., Kaibab National Forest, Southwestern Region.</i></h3>
<p>The Kaibab Plateau, 60 miles long and 40 miles
wide, is rich in scenery, water, wildlife, and timber (ponderosa
pine and Douglas-fir). Once the population of the
great Kaibab deer herd reached 100,000, far beyond the
capacity of the range. Trees were destroyed by wildlife,
and thousands of deer died of starvation. Public hunting
now keeps the herd in balance.</p>
<h3 id="c11"><span class="ss">6</span> <i>Trees for Tomorrow Camp, Eagle River, Wis., Nicolet National Forest, North Central Region.</i></h3>
<p>The marked
nature trail demonstrates how the forest lives and grows,
its relationship with other natural resources, and how
man supplements Nature&rsquo;s management. This camp is
operated by Wisconsin wood industries in cooperation
with the Forest Service as a school primarily for high
school and college students and teachers in conservation.</p>
<h3 id="c12"><span class="ss">7</span> <i>Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest, near Robbinsville, N.C., Nantahala National Forest, Southern Region.</i></h3>
<p>This
3,800-acre tract of primeval wilderness was dedicated in
1936 after the Veterans of Foreign Wars suggested a fitting
shrine be created to the memory of the author of
&ldquo;Trees.&rdquo; Within the national shrine are 100 species of
hardwood trees, including giant yellow-poplars, oaks,
birch, basswood, maple, buckeye, and cherry, with shrubs,
vines, and flowers carpeting the forest floor.</p>
<h3 id="c13"><span class="ss">8</span> <i>Longleaf Trail Vista, near Alexandria, La., Kisatchie National Forest, Southern Region.</i></h3>
<p>This general area includes
some of the highest land in the State, ranging up to
350 feet above sea level. It lies within the Red Dirt Game
Management Area, where demonstration woodlands are
thinned by commercial logging in order to provide food
and improved conditions for wildlife.</p>

<p>This is a 120-acre
primeval forest of towering eastern white pine.
Parts of the land were presented to the Government
by a lumber company and women&rsquo;s clubs. About 15 miles
east of Hearts Content is the Tionesta Scenic Area, nearly
2,000 acres of magnificent virgin hardwoods and eastern
hemlock.</p>

<p>This drive through the heart of

<p class="tb">In addition to these areas, many of the 800 National
Forest ranger stations contain displays on local trees. All
are designed to show the American people how the resources
of the National Forests are cultivated and used to
serve the country now and in the future.</p>

<p>The Multiple Use Tree, based on an ancient symbol for
wood and used as an element of design in this booklet, is
the central figure of the symbol for the National Forests.</p>
<p>Each of the tree&rsquo;s oval branches stands for a renewable
resource of the forest&mdash;water, timber, forage, wildlife,
recreation&mdash;and the products and services flowing from
them. The trunk represents the Nation and its people
who benefit from forest resources.</p>
<p>The line inscribing the tree establishes the interrelationship
and interdependence of resources and their users.
Its continuity symbolizes multiple use management by indicating
that each resource is developed and managed in
coordination with each of the other resources, and that
all are developed and managed for optimum benefits to
the Nation.</p>
<p>The National Forest symbol, created by enclosing the
tree with a ring bearing the legend, <i>National Forests&mdash;Lands
of Many Uses</i>, is a hallmark of service to a growing
America.</p>

<p>The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, is
dedicated to the principle of multiple use management
of the Nation&rsquo;s forest resources for sustained yields of
wood, water, forage, wildlife, and recreation. Through
forestry research, cooperation with the States and private
forest owners, and management of the National Forests
and National Grasslands, it strives&mdash;as directed by Congress&mdash;to
provide increasingly greater service to a
growing Nation.</p>

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
